# ColorGuesser

ColorGuesser is a simple Color Matching game for iOS that was renamed to Iris. 
While it is a simple proof of concept, it is still a fun game for users of all ages. 
The goal of the game is to match the colors of the two rectangles by using the color sliders as well as the + and - buttons. 
I welcome any and all feedback. The easiest way to contact me is via email at BraunDevelopment@icloud.com

The app was my first real dive into iOS development and I plan on continuing my learning by creating more complex applications. 

The code and ideas for the game came from myself and belong to myself. While the code may be referenced to help for a project it may not be reproduced or redistributed wihtout my permission.
