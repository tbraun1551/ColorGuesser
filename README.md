# ColorGuesser

ColorGuesser is a simple Color Matching game for iOS that was renamed to Iris. 
The code and ideas for the game came from myself and belong to myself. While the code may be referenced to help for a project it may not be reproduced or redistributed wihtout my permission. 
Any feedback is welcome. I can be found at tbraun1551@icloud.com
